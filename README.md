# Advent of Code (2020)

## what is it?

[about](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about)
> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

## how am I doing it?

I've been doing this for the last three years and always with a different language. I'll note that I hardly ever finish all of them as other things occupy my time as well, but I find a lot of joy in tackling them.

This year, 2020, I'm doing it in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), the most loved programming language in [Stack Overflow's annual developer survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted). I'm currently learning and using it at my place of employment. It has been the most challenging programming language for me to learn so far, even though there are a ton of familiar ideas and concepts borrowed from some of my favorite languages. Forgive my slow pace :)

I have a `python/` directory in this repo that includes Python 3 solutions as well and only attempt them because I'm stumped with working it out in Rust and want to determine a procedure or algorithm that works before porting it to Rust
